# SysON UX Inspiration

The following UX patterns from the SysON repository and documentation site are strong candidates to emulate in our own tooling.

1. **Contextual Modeling Palette**  
   SysON keeps a slim, context-aware palette that only surfaces elements valid for the current diagram or selection. This cuts down on visual noise and helps users build models faster by showing just-in-time options.

2. **Form-Based Property Editors**  
   Entity properties are edited in structured forms with grouped sections, inline validation, and helper text. Users can tab through fields or jump via a collapsible outline, which makes editing large models feel more like completing a guided wizard.

3. **Diagram ↔ Table Sync Selection**  
   Selecting an element in a diagram highlights the corresponding row in tabular views (and vice versa). The dual highlighting keeps spatial and structured representations synchronized and reduces hunting between views.

4. **Command Palette with Fuzzy Search**  
   SysON exposes modeling commands through a quick-launch palette (⌘/Ctrl+K) that supports fuzzy matching, recent commands, and keyboard-only workflows—ideal for power users.

5. **Inline Change Diffing**  
   When editing textual definitions, the interface provides a split diff preview comparing the current edit with the last saved version. This encourages smaller, reviewable changes before publishing.

6. **Live Validation Panel**  
   Validation warnings and errors stream into a dockable panel in real time, grouped by severity. Clicking an item focuses the offending element and suggests fixes, tightening the model quality loop.

7. **Breadcrumb Navigation for Nested Blocks**  
   As users drill into nested structures, a breadcrumb trail renders at the top of the canvas. Each crumb is clickable, providing fast jumps back up the hierarchy without losing context.

8. **Multi-Representation Tabs**  
   SysON lets users toggle between diagram, form, table, and textual views within a single tab set while preserving selection state. This encourages exploring the same data from different angles without opening new windows.

9. **Guided Onboarding Walkthroughs**  
   First-time users get a sequence of in-app walkthrough bubbles that highlight primary tasks like creating blocks, wiring connections, and exporting reports. Progress indicators and the ability to replay steps make the onboarding reusable for teams.

10. **Export Presets with Preview**  
    The export dialog offers presets (e.g., PDF report, exchange model) and shows a real-time preview of page layout or schema mapping. Users can tweak options and immediately see how outputs will look before committing.

These patterns can inform the design of our SysML authoring experience, ensuring we deliver an efficient, discoverable, and quality-driven workflow inspired by SysON.
