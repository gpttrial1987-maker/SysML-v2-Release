# SysML v2 Release License-Use Matrix

This matrix summarizes LGPLv3 and GPLv3 obligations and recommended practices when a web application embeds SysML v2 libraries or interacts with SysML v2 services. It is not legal advice; confirm specific decisions with counsel.

| Scenario | License Triggered | Do | Don't | Grey Areas / Review with Legal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Embed LGPLv3 SysML v2 library in a web app via dynamic linking or service calls | LGPLv3 (library code)【F:LICENSE†L1-L111】 | * Keep the library separable (e.g., dynamic link, microservice) so users can swap or update it.* Provide copies of the LGPLv3 and GPLv3 licenses with your app and acknowledge library use.* Allow reverse engineering for debugging modifications (no anti-tamper).* Provide installation information if you distribute a combined work on locked-down hardware.【F:LICENSE†L56-L109】 | * Avoid statically linking the library unless you can distribute relinkable object files or source so users can modify the LGPL component.* Don't impose additional restrictions on recipients' modification or debugging rights.【F:LICENSE†L64-L109】 | * Whether a web-delivered binary (e.g., Electron app) counts as "conveying" a combined work if the library stays server-side. Confirm distribution model with legal.* If the app uses code generated from library headers exceeding "small macros/inline functions," you may need to treat it as combined work—verify header usage.【F:LICENSE†L42-L83】 |
| Modify and redistribute LGPLv3 SysML v2 library itself | LGPLv3【F:LICENSE†L32-L111】 | * Share source code for the modified library under LGPLv3.* Note prominent changes and retain original notices.* Offer the modified library in uncombined form if distributing in a larger bundle.【F:LICENSE†L90-L111】 | * Don’t withhold minimal corresponding source or installation info when required.* Don’t relicense modified library under more restrictive terms.【F:LICENSE†L64-L111】 | * Clarify whether API stubs or adapters are part of the library or the application; borderline components might need LGPL treatment. |
| Build a web service that incorporates GPLv3 SysML artifacts and expose functionality over an API | GPLv3【F:LICENSE-GPL†L1-L88】【F:LICENSE-GPL†L89-L160】 | * Make complete corresponding source (including interface definition files and scripts) available to users of the service if you convey binaries.* Include GPL notices and warranty disclaimer in UI or documentation.【F:LICENSE-GPL†L1-L160】 | * Don’t distribute binaries or containers without offering source code under GPLv3.* Avoid adding terms that limit recipients from sharing or modifying the service code.【F:LICENSE-GPL†L89-L160】 | * Pure SaaS access without distributing code might avoid "conveying," but if clients download agents/plugins the GPL may trigger—confirm deployment pathway.* Determine whether generated SysML models are "output" (not covered) or derivative works—evaluate case-by-case.【F:LICENSE-GPL†L60-L103】 |
| Combine GPLv3 SysML components with proprietary web app code and distribute | GPLv3 for entire combined work【F:LICENSE-GPL†L89-L160】 | * Release the combined source code under GPLv3 if you distribute the bundle.* Provide build/install scripts so recipients can recreate binaries and deploy.【F:LICENSE-GPL†L104-L160】 | * Don’t distribute the combined work under proprietary terms.* Don’t use technical measures that prevent installation of modified versions (e.g., locked bootloaders) if distributing on devices.【F:LICENSE-GPL†L120-L160】 | * If GPL components communicate over defined interfaces (e.g., REST APIs) rather than being linked, analyze whether it’s a derivative combined work—legal review advised.* SaaS-only offerings may dodge distribution obligations; verify your jurisdiction and deployment model. |

## General Reminders

* Keep copies of both licenses available wherever you distribute application packages or documentation.【F:LICENSE†L74-L87】【F:LICENSE-GPL†L1-L60】
* Document third-party open-source use and update attribution files when versions change.
* Maintain an internal checklist for code contributions to ensure no incompatible third-party code is introduced without review.
* When in doubt about whether API interactions create a combined/derivative work, escalate to legal counsel before release.
